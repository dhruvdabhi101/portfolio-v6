I am biggest believer of having personal workflow for development. My workflows are pretty straightforward and simple. One of the philosphies that I believe is Keep it simple that anyone can copy it.
I have tried multiple workflows over the years, but my current workflow is my favourite one.

For my text editor, I use neovim with avante.nvim plugin for ai support. I don't use agentic capabilities from avante.nvim. I use it for code completion and code generation mostly.
For my agentic ai needs, Claude code is my goto tool. Auto-accept feature is not my thing, abusing it makes it risky to use. I am not able to get idea of what is getting generated. So i manually review all the changes and accept it one by one so i know what is being done.

For any complex task, i let ai generate some sort of output and then I review it and modify however I want. I do it via avante, I select the function that i want to edit and then ask any llm to make changes to it based on the requirement.
